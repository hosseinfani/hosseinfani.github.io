SCORE: 4 (good)
----- TEXT:
The novelty is the implementation of a benchmarking toolkit for Latent Aspect Detection that allows researchers and practitioners to compare different models on different datasets and metrics in a standardized way. This is an open-source toolkit. It also integrates Backtranslation Augmentation to enhance the quality of the tested models. Finally, it gives the possibility to mask datasets to mimic latent ones and be able to compare models also in this critical scenario.

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the world of research by providing a tool for evaluating and comparing different models for Latent Aspect Detection. The contribution made in the following paper can be of value, allowing researchers and practitioners to compare different models on different datasets and metrics in a standardized way.

The paper is well written. It starts by presenting state-of-the-art Latent Aspect Detection with its aims and weaknesses, motivating the necessity of the proposed toolkit. It gives a detailed description of which aspects LaDy assesses before moving to the implementation description. System design and architecture are clearly and in-depth described with the addition of class diagrams and GitHub repository references. A good description of the Backtranslation Augmentation approach is also given. An Evaluation section follows highlighting the potential of the toolkit to mimic latent datasets thanks to the implementation of a masking method.

Pros:
- Well motivated choice
- Clear description of the technical component used
- Clear description of the implemented classes
- Provided GitHub material with related well-written documentation

Cons:
-

I think the paper is ready for publication and that it would be a good addition to the conference.

The paper aims to advance aspect-based sentiment analysis by focusing on detecting latent aspects in unsolicited online reviews. The paper seeks to address the challenges of reproducibility, extensibility, and the standardization of experimental setups in aspect extraction research. They propose LADy, an open-source platform that leverages back-translation augmentation to improve latent aspect detection. This work is relevant for understanding and improving customer sentiment analysis, especially with the rising significance of unsolicited reviews on platforms such as Google Reviews and Twitter. However, I have the following concerns:

Strengths:
•	The research topic is interesting and easy to read offering LADy as an open-source platform with a web application.
•	The paper presents an innovative approach (back-translation augmentation) to latent aspect detection in unsolicited online reviews.
•	The LADy toolkit offers a standard implementation, benchmark datasets, and adaptability to new metrics and datasets.
•	The paper presents a detailed system design and architecture for LADy, making it a valuable resource for reproducibility and flexibility in aspect-based sentiment analysis research.

Weaknesses:
•	There is a limited discussion on dataset diversity and the specific contribution of back-translation augmentation to performance improvement.
•	The paper lacks a detailed discussion on ethical considerations and user privacy, particularly concerning unsolicited reviews and sensitive information handling.
•	While backtranslation augmentation is highlighted, a detailed comparative analysis showcasing its specific contribution to performance improvement could be further expanded.

Detailed comment:
•	The paper effectively situates LADy within the existing landscape of aspect-based sentiment analysis tools, though it could benefit from a more detailed discussion on how it surpasses these in terms of functionality and usefulness.
•	The base datasets used for comparison are justified; however, expanding the scope of datasets for testing could strengthen the toolkit's validation further.
•	The paper could further elaborate on the specific challenges faced by researchers when dealing with unsolicited reviews, particularly those that contain latent aspects not explicitly mentioned in the paper. A deeper dive into the limitations of current methods in identifying these latent aspects would strengthen the paper's foundation.
•	The discussion on related work could be expanded to include a more detailed critique of how LADy's approach to data augmentation, particularly back-translation, offers advantages over the techniques employed by other tools. Additionally, incorporating a discussion on the potential limitations or challenges of these existing tools could provide a clearer context for LADy's development.
•	The methodology section could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the decision-making process behind choosing specific models and languages for back-translation. In addition, the impact of back-translation on the quality and diversity of aspect detection deserves deeper analysis, particularly in terms of how it affects the detection of latent aspects compared to explicit ones.
•	The paper does not sufficiently address how back-translation augmentation influences the detection of latent aspects (pre- and post-back-translation augmentation). A comparative analysis highlighting the improvements or drawbacks of using backtranslation, along with examples of detected latent aspects before and after augmentation, would provide more insight into the method's efficacy.
•	The paper briefly mentions ethical considerations but does not delve into the specifics of how LADy addresses potential ethical issues associated with using unsolicited reviews. Given the sensitivity of user-generated content, a more detailed discussion on measures taken to ensure privacy, consent, and the anonymization of data would reinforce the paper's ethical credibility.

----------- Detailed comments to authors -----------
This work focused on reproducing aspect based review analysis approaches across various domains and languages. My comments are as follows.

1. This paper lacks substantial insight into the reproduced methods. It could benefit from a more detailed analysis of existing approaches.

2. The evaluation approach based on masking is a novel contribution in this paper.

3. This paper does not release any new dataset. Therefore, its sole contribution in terms of resources is consolidating a repository that houses a compilation of existing datasets in one location.
