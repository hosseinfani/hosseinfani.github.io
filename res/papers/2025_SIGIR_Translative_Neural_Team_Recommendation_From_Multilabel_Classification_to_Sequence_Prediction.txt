SUBMISSION: 1910
TITLE: Translative Neural Team Recommendation: From Multilabel Classification to Sequence Prediction

-------------------------  METAREVIEW  ------------------------
This is the metareview.

The paper received mixed reviews, with referees agreeing that the work is relevant, interesting, and well written.

The major weakness pointed out by R1 is that the task is modeled as a sequence, but there is no guarantee that skills will be ordered. So, how are these sequences constructed?

The short paper program chairs had an extensive discussion about this. Ultimately, it was decided that although this point requires attention and discussion from the authors, it is not sufficient grounds to reject the work. Ultimately, the chairs decided that the benefits of accepting this work outweigh the negatives. However, the authors are urged to very carefully consider the detailed reviews, and incorporate fixes or additional discussion in the camera ready.

TITLE: Translative Neural Team Recommendation: From Multilabel Classification to Sequence Prediction
AUTHORS: Kap Thang, Hawre Hosseini and Hossein Fani

----------- Relevance to SIGIR -----------
SCORE: 2 (excellent)
----- TEXT:
Team Formation is a relevant task for the SIGIR conference.
----------- Novelty -----------
SCORE: 0 (fair)
----------- Technical soundness -----------
SCORE: -1 (poor)
----------- Quality of presentation -----------
SCORE: 0 (fair)
----------- Strengths -----------
The paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence approach for team recommendation, moving beyond traditional multilabel classification methods. This perspective could potentially capture relationships between required skills and selected experts more effectively than previous methods.

The paper benchmarks its proposed method against multiple feedforward neural networks and sequence-based models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), RNNs with attention, Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence models, and Transformers. This allows for a fair comparison and helps highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
----------- Weaknesses -----------
The paper claims to map a sequence of skills to a sequence of experts using sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., Transformers). However, it fails to explain how the sequences were created. In datasets like DBLP, the order of authors is explicit, but skills (keywords) are not inherently ordered, making it unclear how the input sequences were structured. If skills are arbitrarily ordered, the entire premise of using a sequence-based approach is questionable.

The paper assumes that skills and experts follow a meaningful sequential relationship that can be effectively modeled using Transformers. However, it does not provide theoretical or empirical evidence to justify this assumption. Unlike natural language, where word order carries meaning, there is no clear sequence dependency between skills and experts in real-world team formation. Without proving this, the choice of a sequence-based model is unjustified.
----------- Overall recommendation -----------
SCORE: -2 (reject)
----- TEXT:
The paper presents a sequence-to-sequence approach to team recommendation, leveraging transformers to map a sequence of required skills to a sequence of recommended experts. The idea is novel and the empirical results suggest improvements over traditional multilabel classification. The paper benchmarks its proposed method against multiple feedforward neural networks and sequence-based models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), RNNs with attention, Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence models, and Transformers.

The core issue is that the authors do not provide a clear methodology for constructing a sequenced dataset. While they claim that transformers effectively model skill-to-expert mappings, they do not explain how the input sequences (skills) and output sequences (experts) are structured. In datasets like DBLP, where author sequences exist naturally, skill sequences do not.

N/A
----------- Novelty -----------
SCORE: 1 (good)
----------- Technical soundness -----------
SCORE: 0 (fair)
----------- Quality of presentation -----------
SCORE: 1 (good)
----------- Strengths -----------
1. The authors study a useful problem for sequence-to-sequence-based neural team recommendation.
2. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
3. The proposed method is feasible and practical.
----------- Weaknesses -----------
1. The technical contribution of the paper appears to be limited. While the authors reformulate the team recommendation task as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, they do not propose any task-specific architectural innovations or methodological enhancements tailored to the sequence-to-sequence formulation.

2. In the experiments, the authors compare sequence-to-sequence models with existing neural team recommenders and demonstrate improved performance. However, the comparison is restricted to two methods based on variational Bayesian feedforward neural networks. This selection does not comprehensively represent the spectrum of neural team recommendation approaches. The authors are encouraged to include a broader range of baselines, such as graph neural network-based methods and search-based methods, which are also discussed in the related work section.
----------- Overall recommendation -----------
SCORE: 1 (weak accept)
----- TEXT:
Overall, the paper tackles an important problem, is clearly written, and proposes a feasible sequence-to-sequence-based framework for team recommendation. However, the technical novelty appears limited, as the proposed method mainly relies on reformulating the task without introducing dedicated solutions for the new formulation. In addition, the experimental comparison lacks comprehensiveness, as it includes only a narrow subset of existing neural team recommendation methods.

----------------------- REVIEW 4 ---------------------
SUBMISSION: 1910
TITLE: Translative Neural Team Recommendation: From Multilabel Classification to Sequence Prediction
AUTHORS: Kap Thang, Hawre Hosseini and Hossein Fani

----------- Relevance to SIGIR -----------
SCORE: 2 (excellent)
----- TEXT:
The paper proposes a novel method for generating skill-based expert teams, a foundational concept in the information retrieval research community.
----------- Novelty -----------
SCORE: 2 (excellent)
----------- Technical soundness -----------
SCORE: 1 (good)
----------- Quality of presentation -----------
SCORE: 1 (good)
----------- Strengths -----------
1. The paper posits a novel solution to the team formation problem by modeling the task as a sequence prediction rather than the current state-of-the-art, a multi-label classification task which suffers from the sparsity of target expert vectors.

2. The paper provides a clear introduction to the research motivation and covers a broad range of related conducted works, as well as explaining how and why it is relevant to the Information Retrieval community.

3. The methodology provides precise mathematical formulation of the sequence-to-sequence approach to team recommendation, clearly defining how experts are selected conditionally based on required skills.

4. The experimental design is robust, evaluating across four diverse datasets with distinct skill/expert distributions and comparing against established baselines using appropriate classification and IR metrics.

5. The paper achieves a significantly higher performance compared to competitive baselines on key Information Retrieval metrics such as Precision, Recall, MAP, and NDCG.
----------- Weaknesses -----------
1. The related works section adequately presents previous baselines but lacks critical analysis of their strengths and limitations, missing an opportunity to more clearly position the papers' contribution against specific shortcomings of existing approaches.

2. The methodology does not elaborate on the architectural details of the encoder and decoder used for their model. A more detailed diagram or thorough explanation of the mathematical transformation of skills to experts during training and inference would be beneficial to understanding how the results are achieved.

3. Concerning discrepancies exist between baseline performance metrics reported here versus their original publications. For example, the original bnn_emb paper reports a Recall @10 of 5% for the DBLP dataset, whereas here it is reported to be 0.37%

4. Given the quadratic scaling nature of transformers, efficiency considerations must be reported. A table or diagram for comparative analysis of inference time or computational requirements would help readers assess scalability against the multi-label classification approaches.
----------- Overall recommendation -----------
SCORE: 0 (borderline)
----- TEXT:
The paper introduces a fundamentally new approach to team recommendation that achieves substantial performance improvements through sequence modeling. The core contribution of reformulating the problem as sequence prediction instead of multi-label classification is clearly demonstrated and represents an important advance in the field.

The sparse nature of the target expert vectors and underfitting in the multi-label classification approach is a familiar problem to the researchers of the field and the proposed approach by the authors posits a novel solution that, when combined with the improved performance metrics, encourages new avenues of research for members of the Information Retrieval community.

The papers' main shortcomings are the lack of detail and rigor in the methodological shortcomings and the absence of efficiency metrics, which is crucial given that they use transformers as the backbone of the proposed approach. For a short paper, I expect less focus elaborating the results that can be briefly summarized by a table, and more focus on laying the technical foundation to support the work.
