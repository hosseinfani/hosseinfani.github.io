----- TEXT:
This paper explores possible popularity bias in neural team formation techniques. The argument of the paper is that there are experts who receive disproportionate involvement in teams and hence this places other at a disadvantage. The other side of this can be true as well often known as Equity tax: Members of underrepresented groups are often asked to perform too many service activities which again places them in too many service jobs (teams) and hence impacts their performance.

While I like the idea in this paper and think that the issue of fairness in team formation is a nice one, I believe the way the paper approaches this problem could have some down sides:

The main argument of the paper is the tradeoff between fairness and team formation effectiveness. The experiments also show that fairness comes at the cost of effectiveness and the other way around. However, I think there is a fundamental problem with this assumption which comes from how we view the gold standard teams.

As the paper shows, there is significant fairness issues in the gold standard teams already where the long-tail diagram is a quite indication. Therefore, the gold standard that we are using as a basis for evaluating the team formation algorithm already encodes unfairness and captures orthogonality between fairness and effectiveness. Therefore, it is not conceivable, theoretically speaking, that one could develop a team formation method that would maintain effectiveness while at the same time increase fairness. This would not be possible given the way the gold standard is currently set up.

Some minor comments:

- defining popular as those being above the average is not an accurate measure - as average on long-tail distributions is not a reliable measure
- NDKL is mentioned yet not formally defined in the paper. It is important to include it for the sake of readability of the paper
- Similarly Greedy, Relaxed, etc are mentioned but not explained or defined - only a citation to 32 is provided.

----- TEXT:
This paper presents a clear argument demonstrating the challenges of team suggestion using traditional ranking models, and even neural models. It is clear that the underlying datasets present problems for fairly ranking those who might form a successful team. The paper further presents some tweaks to neural algorithms that suggest pathways to successful ranking with less bias toward popularity. All of this is clearly agrued, and well described.

Alongside this is a social argument, that is touched on but not fully explored. This is the challenge of biased social popularity: popular people tend to be from certain race/gender/class groups, and tend to stay popular. What is lacking from this discussion is any discussion of the definitions of success, which are also socially mediated. Take the case of women actors--they are part of the success-popularity loop for a certain time in their lives, but after about age 40 this tends to drop off. Is what is successful necessarily a good metric for what is actually *good* in some way? I don't think this question is readily answered, and creating an algorithm to feed less popular people into the machine won't help bring the social change we need. While this algorithmic tweak is a step in the right direction, it would be nice to see considerably deeper reflection on how it interacts with underlying social biases, rather than merely claiming it is less biased.

----- TEXT:
This paper presented an analysis of neural team formation models. Considering the issues associated with popularity bias, the authors applied re-ranking methods to mitigate these issues.

This work deals with a very interesting and timely topic and provides very interesting insights, both when uncovering the existing biases and when applying the mitigation approaches.

Given the existing issues in terms of accuracy when unbiasing the results, I invite the authors to integrate an analysis and/or a discussion to explore what could be a good trade-off between accuracy and an unbiased team formation, given the results they obtained.
