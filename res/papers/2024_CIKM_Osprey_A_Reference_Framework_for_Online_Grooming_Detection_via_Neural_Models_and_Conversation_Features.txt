SUBMISSION: 2664
TITLE: Osprey: A Reference Framework for Online Grooming Detection via Neural Models and Conversation Features

-------------------------  METAREVIEW  ------------------------
This paper introduces an open-source framework for identifying online grooming attempts. By integrating neural models with conversational features like temporal signals and participant numbers, the framework aims to enhance detection accuracy. While it presents a valuable tool for addressing a significant societal issue and is flexible for future extensions, it relies on older datasets and has some unclear feature contributions. Despite these limitations, the framework's potential impact and the importance of the research justify a recommendation of weak accept.

----------- Paper Summary -----------
The focus of this paper is on online grooming detection. In particular, the authors propose an open-source benchmark library that provides a set of machine learning and deep learning solutions to facilitate easier experimentation by the research community and beyond.
----------- Main Strengths (at least 3) -----------
1. The focus of this paper is on a very important topic, namely online grooming detection, which could have a significant impact on society.
2. The paper would be of interest to CIKM readers.
3. The proposed solution seems interesting.
----------- Main Weaknesses (at least 3) -----------
1. In Figure 1, some example conversations are presented. It would be helpful for the authors to mention if these are real conversations and from which platform they were extracted. If they indeed constitute real conversations, the authors should clearly state whether it is legally acceptable to present them as they are or if anonymisation should take place.

2. Table 1: (i) How were the filtered data derived? (ii) What do you mean by “non-binary predatory conversations”?

3. The authors use a well-established but quite old dataset (dating back to 2012). Therefore, a question about the validity of the observations is raised. Since 2012, the way of communication in online platforms has drastically changed, and this may also apply to the way that online grooming takes place, potentially limiting the validity/effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

4. The authors mention that conversational features are incorporated into the proposed models to improve overall performance. Specifically, two features are considered: temporal signals and the number of participants in a conversation. As mentioned in the paper, and as is quite expected, in conversations such as those studied here, the number of participants is usually two. Therefore, it is unclear how this feature actually contributes to improved performance. To better understand the contribution of both features, the authors can experiment by considering them separately in addition to using both in the models examined here. This way, the contribution of the “number of participants” feature will become clearer.

5. It is not clear why, in the case of “conversation as a sequence of message embeddings,” the authors report results for RNN-, LSTM-, and GRU-based models, while in the case of “conversation as a single embedding,” they report results for SVM- and ff-based models.

6. The authors should provide some information on how the textual information (e.g., Word2Vec, RoBERTa) is combined with the conversational features in the models architecture.

7. It would be nice if the authors reported whether the improvements mentioned in some cases (at least the ones mentioned in the discussion) are statistically significant.

8. It would be beneficial if the authors provided some information on the fine-tuned models. On which specific data did the fine-tuning process take place?
----------- Summary to support your recommendation -----------
Although the proposed solution seems interesting, there are some issues that should be addressed before the paper is ready for publication (see Main Weaknesses).

----------- Paper Summary -----------
The paper proposes a framework for detecting online grooming attempts using neural models and conversation features. The framework is open source and offers the possibility to embed utterances and entire conversations into sparse or dense, contextual or distributional representations. The most import element, which seems to improve performance, is incorporating conversational features into the classification task. The results seem encouraging, and the framework allows flexibility and extension. The authors also discuss the lack of proper datasets on this topic.
----------- Main Strengths (at least 3) -----------
- The framework is modular and extendible.
- Authors propose conversation features to improve classification performance.
- The authors release the code for reproducibility purposes.
- The authors argue the importance of increasing recall for this type of task, whilst not hindering precision.
----------- Main Weaknesses (at least 3) -----------
- The authors should look into the conversational search literature in order to find insight for improving the framework. By using conversational models such as ChatGPT, for example, the implicit conversation features could be derived (without the need for engineering and computing them), and the classification could be further improved.
- It would be interesting to attempt something like early detection, and not only classify the entire conversation but simulate an unfolding conversation, and see at which point the classifier can detect the grooming attempt.
- We see several weaker baselines such as word2vec but no actual competitors are included in the evaluation.
- We see that using newer approaches such as transformer based ones for contextual embeddings do not highly benefit from explicit feature engineering, since they are capable of capturing them implicitly, i.e. conversation features.
----------- Summary to support your recommendation -----------
The paper proposes a solution for the detection of online grooming and predatory behavior in chats. The authors propose an open-source framework for classifying conversations. The results seem encouraging. The framework could be further extended. Evaluation can also be improved by looking into other competitors and taking note of advancements in conversational search and how conversation can be represented in general.

----------- Paper Summary -----------
The authors presented research focused on grooming detection in online dialogues. The problem explored is actual and sound, suits the CIKM community well, and could be implemented and extended to many other similar issues.
----------- Main Strengths (at least 3) -----------
- Very well-written paper which is easy to follow, precise and actual research questions and detailed answers for each of them.

- Strong technical background and high technical novelty of the proposed research

The authors provided detailed and broad comparisons with similar models in the explored area. The obtained results proved the efficiency of the developed method.
----------- Main Weaknesses (at least 3) -----------
- Not clear how to process the false negative results of predatory detection in the dialogues

- Not clear what is the reason for poor results on the fine-tuned embeddings (but it is probably a topic for future research)

- It is challenging to find the appropriate datasets for such a sensitive research topic. Probably it is possible to generate it artificially using the LLMs?
----------- Summary to support your recommendation -----------
The proposed research focused on the actual and relevant problem for the CIKM community, paper is very clear and well-written. The provided code repository is very helpful and makes the results more reproducible for other researchers.
